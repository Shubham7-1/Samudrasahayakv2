1. UI/UX Polish and Final Touches:
Text Readability & Font:

Font Choice: Ensure the font is a readable sans-serif like Roboto, Inter, or Open Sans for optimal screen legibility.

Font Weight & Contrast:

Use Medium or Semi-Bold font weights for headings and important text like "34¬∞C".

Ensure text is high contrast, especially on dark backgrounds.

Avoid overly grayed-out text; it should be clear and easily readable.

Alignment:

Double-check all text and icon alignments.

For example, in the Current Weather card, align the text (Humidity, Pressure, etc.) and their values in their respective columns.

Icons:

Add weather icons to represent details like Humidity, Pressure, Visibility, and Tide Level to improve scannability.

Add icons for each weather condition (e.g., üå°Ô∏è for temperature, üíß for humidity).

Bottom Navigation Bar:

Ensure the "active" tab icon (e.g., "Catch" in yellow) is clearly distinct from the inactive ones.

Consistency:

Maintain consistent button styles, colors, and font sizes across all screens for a smooth user experience.

2. Functional Enhancements:
User Profile Screen:

Add Profile Photo:

Include a circular placeholder above the "Fisherman" title with a camera or plus icon to allow the user to upload a photo.

For now, display a pre-loaded photo for the prototype.

Language Selection:

Add a Language option on the profile screen.

When tapped, it should lead back to the language selection screen that was previously built.

Indicate that users can change the language anytime after the initial setup.

Location Permissions & Map:

Show live location (blue dot) on the map when the user grants location permission.

Enhance the map with some coastal outlines or sea depth indications to make it look more realistic.

Catch Log:

Populate Catch Log:

Pre-fill the Catch Log with 3-4 fictional entries for demonstration purposes. Each entry should include:

A photo of the fish.

Species name (e.g., "Mackerel").

Weight (e.g., 2.5kg).

Time and location (mini-map).

Emergency & Safety:

Simulate an SOS Call action by showing a pop-up like "Dialing Coast Guard (1554)..."

For Border Alert, show the distance changing as the boat moves closer to a simulated border.

3. Information Clarity:
Weather Forecast Icons:

The current colored dots (green and orange) are not very clear.

Add a Legend at the top/bottom of the screen:

üü¢ Green: Good fishing conditions.

üü† Orange: Moderate fishing conditions.

üî¥ Red: Poor fishing conditions.

4. 
Language Selection Screen:


Next to each circle, chnage a colored circle to represent each language's color scheme:

English: Add a black circle (#0078D4).

Hindi : Add an brown circle (#FF5722).

Language Accessibility After Login:

Ensure that language translation is accessible after login, allowing users to change the language from the top-right corner.

Ensure full screen translation based on the user-selected language.

Every word on the screen (titles, buttons, labels) should change according to the selected language.

Implement a language toggle that updates all text elements dynamically without requiring a restart of the app.

Cached Fish Entry with Date Selection:

Add Date Selection: In the Catch Log, provide a date picker for users to view their past catches based on a specific date.

The fisherman should be able to see the date of previous catches along with the other details (e.g., fish species, weight, and location).
